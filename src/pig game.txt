PIG Game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)

----Rules----
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Ann, begins a turn with a roll of 5.
Ann could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.
Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring.
The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.

----Requirements----
1. Must support 2-4 players
Take the number of players as an argument from terminal where the program is executed as
java pig [# players]
example:
java pig 4
There will be 4 players
if a passed in argument is less than 2 or greater than 4, exit immediatly

2. Must take user input from terminal.
Commands:
ROLL - rolls the die
HOLD - hold with current score
QUIT - exit the game
PRINT - shows the current score

3. Must use a method for RollingDice

4. Must use a method to update score

5. Scores must be kept in an appropriate data structure(array or ArrayList)

6. At the end of the game (when someone has reachad 100 points),
you must ask: "Do you want to play again."
The game will be reset if the user enters "yes" or "y" in upper or lower case and you can replay the game.

7. Communicate to the user on what he/she should do. For instance, if the program needs a command then print: "What would you like to do?"

----HINT----
Normally, games have a boolean called playing where:
	playing = true as long as the game is in progress
	AND
	no one has won the game

For this game, playing should be equal to true as long as no player has a score greater than 100

Example:
while ( playing == true){
	roll the dice, take commands, add score, etc...
	if (player_score > 100){
		playing = false;
	}
	if(command == QUIT){
		playing = false;
	}
}
